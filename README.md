This repository continues from the first control in database types. The structure of the repository is as follows:

app.py - A Streamlit application that displays a list of products that are out of stock and need to be reordered, along with supplier and contact information. It is also possible to enter a product ID (e.g., 6), and the application will generate a QR code. This QR code can be scanned to retrieve general product information.

final_movies.csv - A CSV file following the structure/ category-exploding approach Linus had prepared, derived from the movies.json file, but modified accordingly.

fraga_1_grafdatabas.json - A JSON file containing the answer to question 1 regarding graph databases.

fraga_2_grafdatabas.json - A JSON file containing the answer to question 2 regarding graph databases.

kunskapskontroll_1.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook that continues from the first control, containing all questions, answers, code implementations, and markdown notes.

test.py - A Streamlit application that generates QR codes for all out-of-stock products that need to be reordered. It also provides supplier contact information. The QR codes can be scanned to retrieve the necessary details.

visualisation.png - A visualization related to question 3 about graph databases. It illustrates the relationship between Viggo and The Lord of the Rings movies, including information about the director and genres.
